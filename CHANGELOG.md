## 0.0.0b - 12-08-2016
### Changed
- Changed database to PostgresSQL, reorganized repository structure.

### Fixed
- By using PostgresSQL, it allows us to create a more dynamic (and easier to use) database.

### Removed 
- Due to the shear amount of overhaul that needs to be done for the password reset database,
it has been removed and postponed for another date. This will be re-add whenever "most" of the project done.
Same goes for the Facebook and Google+ login.
